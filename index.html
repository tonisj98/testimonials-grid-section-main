  <h1>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
  in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.</h1>

  <p class="section-text-purple">‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a 
  transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
  for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
  The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
  the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

  <h1>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
  learning from their experiences was easy.</h1>

  <p class="section-text-grey">‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
  gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
  junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
  an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù

 <h1>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h1>

  <p class="section-text-stronggrey">‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
  professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
  student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
  did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
  project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
  could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
  experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
  100% recommend! ‚Äù
